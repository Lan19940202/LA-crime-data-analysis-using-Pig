# LA-crime-data-analysis-using-Pig
Apache Sqoop is a goot tool to move large voluminous of structured data. So, in this project, I used sqoop to import crime data happened in 2016 from MySql to HDFS. The file Â 'import.sh' contains the sqoop code. (I have changed the real username and password of the server for safety.)
'pig_script.pig' is the file of Pig Latin code. First, I extracted some meaningful information form the original data set which are:
* 1. Extracted street name from address column;
* 2. Convert datetime to month, day, week and daypart;
* 3.
P.S.: All the data I imported occured in 2016
